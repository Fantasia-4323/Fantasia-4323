- 👋 Hi, I’m @Fantasia-4323 or just Fantasia
- 👀 I’m interested in anything electronic. But maninly laptops/PCs. I prefer Linux OS over Windows OS, but I also know and understand Windows is the only OS for certain programs and activities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML on coddy.tech and learning python on edx.org. I'm going to college for my cyber security degree. Super excited for that part of my book to begin. I have received an official certificate for Kali Linux on courser. (How beleivable that it's official official? Well I'd say I created Kali Linux before I fully beleive it's an acceptable certificate for professionals to look at and NOT laugh at it.) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything beginner wise where I can learn on the way.
- 📫 How to reach me: xyzfantasia1@gmail.com or you can hit my telegram @xyz_fantasia and my google voice number: (484) 575-1571
- ⚡ Fun fact: Pigs can't sweat. I'm extremely good at mowing professionally, I just wanna get out of that trade and learn something new that isn't gonna possibly die at some point.
Does ANYONE know how long EndeavourOS is supposed to take to install?? I'm going on 6 hours and counting right now. The log is showing it's actively working, so I don't know what's going on. But whatever, I got all night 🤣
